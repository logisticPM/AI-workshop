## Introduction

The **MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)** dataset is a cornerstone in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It comprises 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each sized at 28x28 pixels. This project leverages PyTorch, a powerful and flexible deep learning framework, to build a neural network that can accurately classify these digits.

By following this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Handling and transforming image data for model training.
- **Neural Network Construction**: Designing a feed-forward neural network with multiple layers.
- **Model Training**: Optimizing the network using gradient descent techniques.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model on unseen data.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **PyTorch**: Installation instructions can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
- **Torchvision**: Comes bundled with PyTorch, but ensure it's installed.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Git**: For version control and repository management.

You can install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
